# Simple-REST-API-testing
This is a simple project for getting familiar with testing tools such as Postman.

First, I created a local REST API using __Flask__. This is the API that will be used for the automated testing task.  For the automated tests Iâ€™ll be using __Postman__. The steps I took to create the localhost API, set up the libraries and run tests are:

* Install Flask and all packages needed instructed in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-jwt-for-user-authentication-in-flask/
* Create a file named app.py for Flask.
* Write code in app.py.
* Run the terminal command _> flask run_ to run the server.
* Open Postman and create a collection, environment and requests.
* Run the requests and check the responses.
